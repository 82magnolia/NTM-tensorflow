Neural Turing Machine in Tensorflow
===================================

Tensorflow implementation of [Neural Turing Machine](http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401). The referenced torch code and dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/kaishengtai/torch-ntm).

Neural Turing Machine use an external memory (the tape) with a neural network which is differentialbe from end-to-end. Therefore, the model can be trained via gradient descnet, and the system is albe to learn some algorithms such as copying, priority sorting etc.
